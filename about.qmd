Hi!

I am Fl√°via!

I am a data scientist with a background on biomedical sciences. 
I have switched from wet lab to dry lab during my PhD, in which I studied cancer epigenomics, using a lot of bioinformatics both in R and bash.

Now I work as a data scientist in Mendelics, the biggest genomics laboratory of Latin America.
Mostly I work with research and analysis of DNA sequencing data. 

I also mentor people in R programming, statistics and bioinformatics. 

I have 118 5-star reviews in [codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@flaviaerius). 
I really love to have this contact with people all over the world, and help them with their struggle coding or understanding a concept, especially because I've been there before and I know how hard that is.

I love learning new things! 

I wanted to learn everything about everything! But I know I can't, so I focus on some few topics at a time, being now mostly data science and genomics-related, apart from other variable topic.

I believe _mens sana in corpore sano_ is totally true, so I like doing some exercise, and I have ran a couple of half marathons before - not suited for any ball-involving sport though. 

Welcome! I hope you enjoy and that you can take something useful or entertaining from here :)
